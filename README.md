This project was designed to follow up my first project about building PCs. The main premise is to teach users what components fits on a motherboard. The website is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate.

The user drags images from the button into boxes on either side of the main image. After dragging all the images to the relevant boxes, the user clicks the submit button and a visual feedback of either correct or incorrect is displayed, being green or red respectively.

Below is a wireframe of the concept of the page.
